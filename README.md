### Getting Started 🎉

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn install`

Install dependencies

`yarn start:server` it runs server
`yarn start:webapp` it runs webapp
`yarn start` it runs both

Runs the app in the development mode and starts the server on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
